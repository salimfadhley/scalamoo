An attempt to create a MOO like experience in Scala

I've always loved these text-based adventures. Most of the games that still remain online
are based on traditional programming languages (e.g. C++, Pascal). 

I'm trying to create a text-based virtual using modern development tools (e.g. Scala, IntlliJ).
