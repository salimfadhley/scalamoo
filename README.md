An attempt to create a [MOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO) like experience in Scala

I've always loved these text-based adventures. Most of the games that still remain online
are based on traditional programming languages (e.g. C++, Pascal). 

I'm trying to create a text-based virtual using modern development tools (e.g. Scala, IntlliJ).

# Big Thanks

 doubt the world;s best IDE for Scala and Python developers.
